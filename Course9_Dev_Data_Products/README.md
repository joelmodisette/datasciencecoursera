# Coursera Course 9 Week 4 Project - Developing Data Products

## Project Guidance

This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, I created a Shiny application and deployed it on Rstudio's servers. Second, I used  Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about my application.

## What the Project is About

The R Shiny application allows the user to explore how cyber threat actors use techniques for exploitation. The techniques then relate to general tactics which explain how a cyber actor is attacking. All data comes from the MITRE ATT&CK v10.1 Cyber Threat Landscape. ATT&CK V10.1 was published in November 2021. The datasets are pulled from the MITRE website.

## Data

The data for this project comes from Mitre ATT&CK, an open source cybersecurity intelligence repository. The repository relates cyber threat actors, attack techniques, software (malware) and general adversarial tactics. The version of ATT&CK is v10.1, published in November 2021.
